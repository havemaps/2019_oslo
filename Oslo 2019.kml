        <description>Vippa is a really cool food hall in Oslo! There was a wide range of food and drinks available. I had sweet potato tacos and spinach dumplings as well as a local beer.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[While I was in Oslo, there was a street fair in Grunerlokka, a neighborhood with a lot of vintage shops, boutiques, bars, restaurants. I brought only a small carry-on bag with me to Oslo, so I didn't buy anything. I did stop at the BrewDog bar and had the Jet Black Heart coffee stout.]]></description>

        <name>Munch Museum</name>
        <description>The Munch Museum was definitely a highlight. I saw the painting The Scream. I was not previously familiar with much else Munch had done, but I really enjoyed the rest of his work. He had some incredible, massive paintings that I did not expect. The museum is about to move to a new location, so the curators had some special exhibitions about the history of the museum.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[The Oslo Opera House is near the city center on the water, and it is meant to look to look like an iceberg. The architecture allows visitors to walk up to the roof for some nice panoramic views of Oslo's city center. The inside was very nice, too.<br><img src="https://github.com/havemaps/2019_oslo/blob/master/images/operaHouse.JPG?raw=true"alt="Image of the outside of opera house in Oslo.
